    <p>
    This homemade lasagna is a classic layered pasta dish that combines seasoned ground beef with rich tomato sauce, slices of ham,
    and plenty of melted cheese.
    The noodles are boiled until tender, then assembled in layers with sauce, ham, and mozzarella, creating a hearty, comforting meal.
    After baking in the oven until the cheese is bubbly and golden, the lasagna becomes a satisfying dish perfect for family dinners or gatherings.
